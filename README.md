# Machine-Learning-A-Z-Udemy
Welcome to the Machine-Learning-A-Z-Udemy repository! This repository contains projects and exercises completed as part of the "Machine Learning A-Z" course offered by Udemy. This course covers a wide range of machine learning topics, from data preprocessing to advanced techniques. It includes data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, association rule learning, dimensionality reduction, model selection, deep learning, NLP.

## Course Overview
The course includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Regression**: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
- **Classification**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, and Random Forest Classification.
- **Clustering**: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Association Rule Learning**: Apriori and Eclat.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
- **Model Selection**: Model evaluation techniques and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Deep Learning**: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text preprocessing, Bag of Words, and Word Embeddings.
